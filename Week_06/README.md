## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?

When you add more than two bits together, you will wire a carry out from the first full adder and that same wire will be the carry in of the second full adder.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

It is used to calculate the sum of binary inputs.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?

The largest number would be 3. If it goes over it could overflow leading to an incorrect result.
