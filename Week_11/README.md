## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
- Edge sensitive circuits respond to a signals change from low to high or high to low, while level-sensitive circuits respond to the signals high or low state for as long as it's active.
### Why is it important to declare initial state?
- It allows a starting point for the system, allowing for accurate analysis and prediction of its behavior over time.
### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
- It allows us to build systems that can store data and remember past states.
